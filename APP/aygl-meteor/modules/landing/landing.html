					The league aims to cultivate a community, where individuals without a formal team are able to experience high-level competitive gameplay. It is ideal for players who want to showcase themselves, meet like-minded individuals and bring their game to the next level.

				    <p>
					The prospect of a strong professional eSports scene in SEA is present, but there is a lack of a platform to nurture this talent. By creating an in-house environment, AYGL hopes to breathe life into the SEA dota community. AYGL will be the platform where players with dreams of entering the professional scene can take their first step. We plan to be the hub where exceptional players and casters get noticed, and where sponsors scout potential stars and teams.

		    <p>
		    AYGL is a SEA (South-East Asia) exclusive invite-only free-to-play in-house league for Dota2. The league aims to cultivate a community, where individuals without a formal team are able to experience high-level competitive gameplay. It is ideal for players who want to showcase themselves, meet like-minded individuals and bring their game to the next level.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			The prospect of a strong professional eSports scene in SEA is present, but there is a lack of a platform to nurture this talent. By creating an in-house environment, AYGL hopes to breathe life into the SEA dota community. AYGL will be the platform where players with dreams of entering the professional scene can take their first step. We plan to be the hub where exceptional players and casters get noticed, and where sponsors scout potential stars and teams.

		    This pool of casters and the broadcasting channel will be where AYGL will also seek to grow its prize pool. From the broadcasts of highly skilled games, AYGL plans to garner sponsorship to increase the prize pool and thus encouraging more players into the league. In the long run, this increases the legitimacy of eSports in SEA with higher prize pools and enables the SEA scene to showcases its vast pool of talented players.
